JSX 

JSX  is using  a React object that it has access to when you 
import React from 'react'

And then essentially your return block written in JSX is passed the React object and the .createElement() is called.

Return React.createElement(
	'div',
	{},
	React.createElement('h2', {}, "Let's get started"),
    React.createElement(Expenses, {items:expenses}
);

would be the JSX under the hood look for this code

return (
    <div>
        <h2>Let's get started</h2>
        <Expenses items={expenses}
    </div>
);
